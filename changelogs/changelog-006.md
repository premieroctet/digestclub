### Enhancements

- **Trending Bookmarks**: Links bookmarked multiple times in your team are now grouped. For easier access a dedicated badge now displays the number of team members which have saved the link. No more link duplication ! Get to the point and be sure not to publish a link twice anymore.

- **Add Text Block**: Get faster access to Text Blocks from digest edition with a new quick add button displayed between blocks on hovering.

- **Text Block Edition**: A typo in a text block ? No need to delete it anymore simply edit it with the new option button available.

### Bug Fixes

- **Invitation Fix**: We've resolved the bug that was previously blocking the invitation links.

- **Prevent link duplication**: Users can no longer bookmark the same link multiple times in the same Team. No more team spamming !
