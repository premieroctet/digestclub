### New Features

- **Text Block**: We are thrilled to introduce the text block feature! You can now add text blocks that support **markdown** formatting to your Digests. Customize your content with headings, lists, links, emphasis, and more to create rich and engaging Digests.

### Getting Started with Markdown Blocks

To start using the Markdown Block feature, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Digest builder for the Digest you wish to edit or create a new Digest.
2. Click on the ellipsis (`...`) button in the top right corner of a block to open the block menu.
3. Then, click on the **Add text block after** button.
4. Start writing or paste your markdown content into the block editor.
5. Save your changes, and the markdown block will be added to your Digest.

### Markdown Syntax Guide

Use familiar markdown syntax to format your text within the new text block:

- Headings: Use hashtags (`#`) for different heading levels.
- Lists: Create ordered lists using numbers or unordered lists using dashes (`-`) or asterisks (`*`).
- Links: Enclose the link text in square brackets (`[]`) followed by the URL in parentheses (`()`).
- Emphasis: Add emphasis to text using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`).
- Code: Wrap code snippets with backticks (\```) to preserve their formatting.
- And more: Explore additional markdown syntax options for formatting your content.

### Tips for effective use of text blocks

Here are a few tips to make the most out of text blocks in your Digests:

1. Use headings to create clear sections and structure within your Digest.
2. Format important information or highlights using emphasis or bullet points.
3. Incorporate links to external resources or relevant articles to provide additional context.
4. Experiment with different markdown features to make your Digests visually appealing and easy to read.

Please keep in mind that Markdown blocks cannot be converted to tweet. As a result, they will not be compatible with thread generation via _Typefully_
