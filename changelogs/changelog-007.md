  Next time you're on the [dashboard](https://digest.club/teams) and ready to create a new digest, simply click on **Use Template**. Choose the template that fits your needs, and your selected structure is applied instantly.

  This practical feature lets you concentrate on crafting content without the hassle of repetitive formatting, making digest creation a breeze!
