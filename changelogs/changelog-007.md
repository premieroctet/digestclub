### Enhancements

- **Bookmarked Links Metrics**: Introducing a graph interface in the team's [dashboard](https://digest.club/teams), showcasing a neat graph that count and group all bookmarks per month. This enhancement allows users to visually track their team's contributions over time.

- **Digest Title Prediction**: AI is coming on Digest Club! We've added a feature for predicting digest titles. AI will try to predict the title of your digest based on the title of your previous digests.

- **Discovers Page**: Explore latest digest made by the community in this new [page](https://digest.club/discover)

- **Digests Template**: You can now save the markdown blocks of a digest as a template, creating a reusable structure for all your future digests.

  When you're in the digest builder, just click on **Save as Template**. Give your template a name, hit save, and voilà! Your template is ready to roll.

  Next time you're on the [dashboard](https://digest.club/teams) and ready to create a new digest, simply click on **Use Template**. Choose the template that fits your needs, and your selected structure is applied instantly.

  This practical feature lets you concentrate on crafting content without the hassle of repetitive formatting, making digest creation a breeze!

- **Digest Views Count**: Keep track of your digest's popularity with a view counter on the [dashboard](https://digest.club/teams). Now you can see how many times your digests have been read.

### Bug Fixes
